## SPECS
The program makes use of a Ticket constructor.

The Ticket constructor has the following properties:
    1. Name of movie.
    2. Time of day.
    3. Age of customer.

There are 3 distinct types of movies:
    1. Debut Films.
    2. Post-release Films.
    3. Vintage Classics.

Each movie, once selected, should have an accompanying image.

The time-of-day property is a drop-down list with 5 different showing times.

The age property will be divided into two categories:
    1. <=50
    2. >=51
The second category is slightly cheaper.

Clicking one movie hides any other currently shown.
## License
